# refactored-algorithms


Will have basic and advanced coding challenges.

Here's the basic workflow:

```bash
[~]         $ cd exercises
[exercises] $ npm install
[exercises] $ cd debounce
[debounce]  $ vi index.js
[debounce]  $ npm test
```
This uses a basic TDD approach so take a look at the test.js file in each directory to see what needs to be implemented, write an index.js as the solution file


Run all tests with ```npm run test-all```
